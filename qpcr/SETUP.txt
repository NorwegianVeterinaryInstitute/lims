## 1. Generate placement map
On the qPCR QC 5.0 process type (ops interface), do this:
  - On Output Generation, choose Shared Output: SharedResultFile and increment the 
    "fixed number of outputs" to 4. Add the string "sample_map.csv," (with a comma)
    directly after LIST:. The file must be the first one, as that is referenced in the 
    command.
  - Add an external program:
    Channel Name: limsserver
    Name: Generate placement map
    Command line call: /usr/bin/python /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions/lims/qpcr/generate-sample-grid.py {processLuid} {compoundOutputFileLuid0}

In web interface, edit the qPCR QC step in the Library Validation protocol. Set the
Generate placement map to run: automatically initiated, on Record Details, when screen is entered.

## 2. Compute concentration
On the qPCR QC 5.0 process type:
xxxx


## 3. Fragment length

The fragment length is written by the modified Aggregate QC process. To show the fragment
length in the qPCR step: In web UI, config qPCR step, Record details:
Add the Fragment Length property of the Derived Sample to the Selected field in the Sample 
Details section.
