###### Normalisation setup

The normalisation step uses the Molarity UDF set by the Tapestation and qPCR processes
to determine the instructions for how to normalise a library to X nM concentration.

The protocol is to aliquot a predefined volume out of the "input" library and then add
a variable amount of buffer liquid. The script in this directory computes the amount of
buffer that is required to reach a target molar concentration.
