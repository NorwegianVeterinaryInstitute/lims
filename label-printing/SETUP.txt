# Label printing scripts

The script can print labels using an OpenOffice template file. It requires the label printer's driver to
be installed locally, and will call the LibreOffice executable to start printing.


## Setup

The scripts are now run on LIMS-PC6 because it has a direct connection to the label printer.
It has an automation worker node in the channel limspc6, that will execute commands directly on the LIMS PC.

Python is installed in C:\Python27. Many of the dependencies are however installed directly in C:\AiScripts.
The script is also installed in C:\AiScripts. Any changes to the script here in git or in C:\AiScripts need to
be synced manually.

Dependencies installed locally in C:\AiScripts (top level):

* appy
* genologics
* hubarcode
* oopy

Required by genologics / requests:

* requests
* idna
* chardet
* certifi
* urllib3


The dependencies don't require any native code, so they can be installed simply by unzipping the python .whl files,
and copying the module's directory.
