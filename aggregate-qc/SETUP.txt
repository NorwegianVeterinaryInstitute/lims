### Aggregate QC setup

The Fragment length field needs to be added to the aggregate qc step. The
following configuration changes are necessary:

UDF configuration: 

1. Analyte UDF
   Add a UDF to analyte: Name: Fragment Length, Type: Numeric, Decimal places: 1.


Process types (operations interface):

2. Edit Aggregate QC (choose appropriate instance, DNA, RNA, etc)

   Add an external program: 
     Channel: limsserver
     Name: Set Tapestations fragment length
     Command line call: /usr/bin/python /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions/lims/aggregate-qc/set-tapestation-frag-length.py {processLuid}

Edit appropriate protocol step in Web UI: Aggregate QC:
    On Record Details page, add Derived Sample > Fragment Length. (Analyte UDF added above)
