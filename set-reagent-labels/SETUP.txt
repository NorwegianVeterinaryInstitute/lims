### Set reagent label script

The script takes as the first argument the index category, and all 
subsequent arguments are interpreted as analyte (derived sample) IDs. It
is used with the Project Dashboard's Derived Sample Actions.


## Installation

In the web UI, under Configure, Automation, choose "Add action".

Action Name: Set TruSeq DNA LT Indexes
Channel Name: limsserver
Command Line: /usr/bin/python /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions/lims/set-reagent-labels/set-reagent-labels.py "<CATEGORY>" {derivedSampleLuids}
Command Line Example: /usr/bin/python /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions/lims/set-reagent-labels/set-reagent-labels.py "TruSeq DNA LT Adapters (AD series)" {derivedSampleLuids}


One such action must be added for each index type.
