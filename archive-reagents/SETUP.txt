#### Setup instruction for automatic reagent archiving 

The script is called from an automation trigger on a process type. One automation 
trigger (external program) must be created for each process type.

For the process type which uses the reagents, add an external program:
Channel name: limssserver
Name: Archive reagent lots
Command line: /usr/bin/python /opt/gls/clarity/customextensions/lims/archive-reagents/archive-reagents.py {processLuid}


In the web UI; protocol step configuration, set the script to run automatically at the
end of the step.
